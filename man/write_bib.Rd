\usage{
write_bib(x = .packages(), file = "", tweak = TRUE, width = NULL, 
    prefix = getOption("knitr.bib.prefix", "R-"))
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Package names. Packages which are not installed are ignored.}

\item{file}{The (\file{.bib}) file to write. By default, or if \code{NULL},
output is written to the R console.}

\item{tweak}{Whether to fix some known problems in the citations, especially
non-standard format of author names.}

\item{width}{Width of lines in bibliography entries. If \code{NULL},
lines will not be wrapped.}

\item{prefix}{Prefix string for keys in BibTeX entries; by default, it is
\samp{R-} unless \code{\link{option}('knitr.bib.prefix')} has been set to
another string.}
}
\value{
A list containing the citations. Citations are also written to the \code{file} as a
  side effect.
}
\description{
This function uses \code{\link[utils]{citation}} and
\code{\link[utils]{toBibtex}} to create bib entries for R packages and write
them in a file. Only the auto-generated citations are included for a package.
This function can facilitate the auto-generation of bibliography databases
for R packages, and it is easy to regenerate all the citations after updating
R packages.
}
\details{
The citation is forced to be generated from the \file{DESCRIPTION} file of
the package (\code{citation(auto = TRUE)}). The keyword \samp{R-pkgname} is
used for the bib item, where \samp{pkgname} is the name of the package. All
references specified in the \file{CITATION} file of the package are ignored.
The main purpose of this function is to automate the generation of the
package citation information because it often changes (e.g. author, year,
package version, ...). By comparison, paper/book citations don't change too
often, so it is not a lot of work even if you just cut and paste such
bibliography entries from \code{toBibtex(citation())}.
}
\note{
Some packages on CRAN do not have standard bib entries, which was once
  reported by Michael Friendly at
  \url{https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-devel/2010-November/058977.html}. I
  find this a real pain, and there are no easy solutions except contacting
  package authors to modify their DESCRIPTION files. Anyway, the argument
  \code{tweak} has provided ugly hacks to deal with packages which are known
  to be non-standard in terms of the format of citations; \code{tweak = TRUE}
  is by no means intended to hide or modify the original citation
  information. It is just due to the loose requirements on package authors
  for the DESCRIPTION file. On one hand, I apologize if it really mangles the
  information about certain packages; on the other, I strongly recommend
  package authors to consider the \samp{Authors@R} field (see the manual
  \emph{Writing R Extensions}) to make it easier for other people to cite R
  packages. See \code{knitr:::.tweak.bib} for details of tweaks. Also note
  this is subject to future changes since R packages are being updated. If
  you want to contribute more tweaks, please edit the file
  \file{inst/misc/tweak_bib.csv} in the source package.
