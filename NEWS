			 CHANGES IN knitr VERSION 0.2

NEW FEATURES

  o added support for including child documents in a main document
  (like \SweaveInput{} but with different implementations); see
  http://yihui.github.com/knitr/demo/child/ (#92)

  o for inline R code, character results are returned as-is now
  (without \texttt{})

  o new function purl() as a wrapper to knit(..., tangle = TRUE) which
  extracts R code from the input document (thanks to Dieter Menne's
  wife who suggested the function name)

  o the error hook applies to inline R code when an error occurs in
  the inline R code, in which case knitr will not stop by default;
  instead, it writes the error message into the output (#85)

  o chunk option 'split' also works for HTML output now using
  '<iframe></iframe>' (#82)

  o knit() gained an argument `text` as an alternative to 'input'
  (#88)

  o new chunk option 'child' to include child documents into the main
  document (#92)

  o chunk option 'external' defaults to TRUE now (was FALSE by default
  in the last version)

  o added a new demo to show how to build package vignettes with
  knitr: http://yihui.github.com/knitr/demo/vignette/

  o added support to the quartz() device under Mac (#103); now the
  'dev' option has more choices (see
  http://yihui.github.com/knitr/options)

  o chunk option 'echo' can take a numeric vector to select which R
  expressions to echo into the output now (#108); see
  http://yihui.github.com/knitr/options

  o a new function stitch() which is a convenience function to insert
  an R script into a template and compile (to quickly create a report
  based on an R script)

  o for a chunk hook to run, the corresponding chunk option no longer
  has to be TRUE; it can be any non-null values; this enables us to
  make use of the option value directly instead of only knowing it is
  TRUE (see http://yihui.github.com/knitr/demo/cache/ for an example)

  o knit() will no longer writes figure or cache files in the same
  directory as the input document; instead, these files are written in
  the current working directory (see ?knit)

  o a new function knit_env() that makes the environment of the
  current chunk accessible to the user

BUG FIXES

  o the code used to merge global chunk options and local options was
  buggy for cache; it has been fixed now, so cache is more stable
  (#105), but users may see previously cached chunks being
  re-evaluated with this version, which should be regarded as a normal
  phenomenon, and on the second run, the cached chunks will not be
  evaluated again

  o fixed a buglet when using both options 'out.width' and
  'out.height' in Rnw (#113)
