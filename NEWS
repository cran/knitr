			 CHANGES IN knitr VERSION 0.3

NEW FEATURES

  o a fundamental and important new feature for writing chunk options:
  they can be written as valid R code now, just like we write function
  arguments (e.g. echo=c(1, 3, 5), fig.cap="my figure caption"); all
  options will be parsed and evaluated as R code by default; see
  http://yihui.name/knitr/options for details (#142) (thanks, Baptiste
  Auguie)

  o chunk references using <<label>> is supported now (#86); thanks to
  Kevin R. Coombe and Terry Therneau for the discussion

  o new function run_chunk() to run the code in a specified chunk,
  which is an alternative to the chunk reference in Sweave; see
  http://yihui.name/knitr/demo/reference/

  o a executable script 'knit' under system.files('bin', package =
  'knitr') which makes it easier to call knitr via command line under
  *nix (call 'knit input [output] [--pdf]')

  o the inline hooks respect getOption('digits') and
  getOption('scipen') now (see ?options); numbers returned from inline
  R code will be formatted according to these two options (see a demo
  at http://yihui.name/knitr/demo/output/)

  o if you still use old Sweave syntax for chunk options, it is
  possible to write literal commas in chunk options now -- they have
  to be escaped by \, e.g. caption=hello\, world; this will be parsed
  to 'hello, world' as a character string; of course this looks ugly
  and has limited power, so please please consider the new syntax!

  o knit2pdf() gained another argument 'compiler' which can be used to
  specify the program to compile the tex document to PDF, such as
  xelatex (#131) (thanks, Ramnath Vaidyanathan and Dennis Murphy)

  o a new function imgur_upload() to upload images to imgur.com; it
  can be used in HTML or Markdown hooks so the output is a
  self-contained document which does not need additional image files;
  opts_knit$get('upload') controls whether to upload images
  automatically (#66)

  o a child document can be compiled individually with the LaTeX
  preamble borrowed automatically from a parent document using a new
  function set_parent(); see the help page for details (#136) (thanks,
  Helder Correia)

  o to avoid $$ around numbers in the inline output, we can use I() to
  protect the numeric inline output, e.g. $x = \Sexpr{I(10^7)}$ gives
  $x = 10^7$ whereas \Sexpr{10^7} gives $10^7$ (thanks, Kevin
  Middleton)

  o the listings package is formally supported now (see
  ?render_listings); the default style is borrowed from Sweavel.sty
  written by Frank Harrell (#101) (thanks, Frank)

  o new package option 'cache.extra' which allows more objects to
  affect cache; see http://yihui.name/knitr/demo/cache/ (#134)

  o new package option 'child.path' to specify the search path of
  child documents relative to the parent document (#141)

  o new package option 'aliases' to set aliases for chunk options; see
  http://yihui.name/knitr/options (#144)

  o new chunk options 'fig.cap', 'fig.scap' and 'fig.lp' to write
  captions, short captions, label prefix for the figure environment in
  LaTeX (#145) (thanks, Frank Harrell)

  o new package option 'eval.after' to set a character vector of chunk
  options which should be evaluated _after_ a chunk is executed
  (thanks, Frank Harrell)

  o a series of convenience functions pat_rnw(), pat_tex(), pat_brew()
  and pat_html() to set built-in patterns (syntax) to read input

MINOR CHANGES

  o package option 'eval.opts' has been dropped: all options of
  classes 'symbol' or 'language' will be evaluated, so there is no
  need to specify which options to evaluate manually; remember, the
  chunk options are similar to function arguments, so you can use any
  valid R code there
  
  o the default value for the 'output' argument in knit() is NULL now,
  so we can also provide output filenames to stitch() and knit2pdf()
  (#119)

  o standard LaTeX messages are suppressed when a tikz plot is
  compiled to PDF so that we can see the knitr process more clearly

  o %\SweaveInput{} will be ignored now (#150)

  o results=asis will no longer affect the 'chunk' hook (in the past,
  the chunk output was not wrapped in the kframe environment when
  results=asis); it only affects the 'output' hook now

  o the package website allows comments now

MAJOR CHANGES

  o the starting pattern of normal texts in an Rnw document is
  '^@\\s*%*' instead of '^@\\s*$' now, meaning you can write '@ % a
  comment' to end a code chunk (this is consistent with Sweave)

  o the default value of the argument 'output' of knit() will be a
  filename under the current working directory; in previous versions,
  the output file will be under the same directory as the input file;
  this change makes it possible to completely separate the input files
  and output files into different places, and hopefully will give
  users better experience in managing a whole collection of files
  (including child documents): put all source files in one place and
  output files in another place

  o the package homepage is http://yihui.name/knitr now (the previous
  URL yihui.github.com/knitr will be automatically redirected to the
  new address)

BUG FIXES

  o the object opts_current does not give the evaluated version of the
  current chunk options because it was created before the options are
  evaluated; this has been fixed and opts_current$get() will give the
  expected values of options (thanks, Frank Harrell)

MISC

  o number of downloads (https://github.com/yihui/knitr/downloads) of
  knitr documentation before I removed and updated them on GitHub:
  c(main = 1300, graphics = 549, themes = 130, beamer = 565, listings
  = 240, minimal = 160)

			 CHANGES IN knitr VERSION 0.2

NEW FEATURES

  o added support for including child documents in a main document
  (like \SweaveInput{} but with different implementations); see
  http://yihui.name/knitr/demo/child/ (#92)

  o for inline R code, character results are returned as-is now
  (without \texttt{})

  o new function purl() as a wrapper to knit(..., tangle = TRUE) which
  extracts R code from the input document (thanks to Dieter Menne's
  wife who suggested the function name)

  o the error hook applies to inline R code when an error occurs in
  the inline R code, in which case knitr will not stop by default;
  instead, it writes the error message into the output (#85)

  o chunk option 'split' also works for HTML output now using
  '<iframe></iframe>' (#82)

  o knit() gained an argument `text` as an alternative to 'input'
  (#88)

  o new chunk option 'child' to include child documents into the main
  document (#92)

  o chunk option 'external' defaults to TRUE now (was FALSE by default
  in the last version)

  o added a new demo to show how to build package vignettes with
  knitr: http://yihui.name/knitr/demo/vignette/

  o added support to the quartz() device under Mac (#103); now the
  'dev' option has more choices (see http://yihui.name/knitr/options)

  o chunk option 'echo' can take a numeric vector to select which R
  expressions to echo into the output now (#108); see
  http://yihui.name/knitr/options

  o a new function stitch() which is a convenience function to insert
  an R script into a template and compile (to quickly create a report
  based on an R script)

  o for a chunk hook to run, the corresponding chunk option no longer
  has to be TRUE; it can be any non-null values; this enables us to
  make use of the option value directly instead of only knowing it is
  TRUE (see http://yihui.name/knitr/demo/cache/ for an example)

  o knit() will no longer writes figure or cache files in the same
  directory as the input document; instead, these files are written in
  the current working directory (see ?knit)

  o a new function knit_env() that makes the environment of the
  current chunk accessible to the user

BUG FIXES

  o the code used to merge global chunk options and local options was
  buggy for cache; it has been fixed now, so cache is more stable
  (#105), but users may see previously cached chunks being
  re-evaluated with this version, which should be regarded as a normal
  phenomenon, and on the second run, the cached chunks will not be
  evaluated again

  o fixed a buglet when using both options 'out.width' and
  'out.height' in Rnw (#113)
